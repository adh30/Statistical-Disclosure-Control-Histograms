# Statistical Disclosure Control Histograms
## Histograms compatible with Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) guidance
These are simple Stata programs for producing histograms in conformance with SDC guidance (see Handbook on SDC.pdf)

**binsafe** plots a histogram of the distribution of a variable constructed so that each bar represents the same fraction of the data (constant area histogram). No fraction contains fewer than 10 observations to accord with SDC guidance [1]. If all bin areas are >10 then the bin number is assigned using Sturges' rule [2].

**histsdc**  plots a frequency histogram that is compatible with Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) guidance by replacing any value less than 10 with the value 10. A note is added to the histogram to this effect.

To use these just copy the ado file and its associated sthlp file into your personal directory.
